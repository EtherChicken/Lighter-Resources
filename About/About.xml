  <description>Changed most of the resources in base RimWorld to have .01 mass, helps with hauling lots of mined resources with "Pick Up and Haul" and works well with LVM's Dark Storage since it has weight restrictions. If a resource is not changed that you would like changed let me know and I'll change it if I feel it fits the mod, else I will make a new mod.
